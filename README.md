This is a simulator for 3 different memory management algorithms used in the UNIX operating system.
It simulates VSP (Variable Size Partitioning), Paging (PAG), and Segmentation (SEG). Both Paging and Segmentation can be run with Best, Worst, or First fit variations.
To run it just run main.py and enter the parameters you want. In the data folder there are example input files you can use as well as files with the expected output for certain algorithms.
The program ouputs events to the screen and to a file named for the algorithm used. Events are a new process arrives, a new process is added to memory, and a process finishes and is removed from memory.

"OS Program 2 Write Up.odt" is a explanation of how the program and each algorithm work.

This program was created for my Operating Systems class.
